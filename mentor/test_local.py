        Hi [CEO],

        Thanks for the deck and financials. Our partnership is very interested.
        A few questions:

        1. What's your current burn rate?
        2. Customer acquisition cost (CAC) trends?
        3. Technical team size and hiring plans?

        We'd like to move quickly - can we schedule a partner meeting next week?

        Best,
        Lead Investor
