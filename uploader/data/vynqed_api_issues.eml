Subject: API Integration Issues - Urgent
Date: Wed, 17 Oct 2024 14:45:00 -0700

Team,

We're experiencing critical issues with our third-party API integrations that need immediate attention:

**Issue Summary:**
- Payment gateway API returning 500 errors
- CRM sync failing intermittently
- Analytics data not syncing properly

**Impact:**
- Customer payments failing (~15% failure rate)
- Sales data incomplete
- Customer support tickets increasing

**Immediate Actions Needed:**
1. Check API rate limits and quotas
2. Review error logs from last 24 hours
3. Test API endpoints manually
4. Contact vendor support if needed

**Next Steps:**
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Add better error handling and logging
- Consider backup API providers

This is affecting our revenue directly. Please prioritize this and provide updates every 2 hours.

Thanks,
David Kim
