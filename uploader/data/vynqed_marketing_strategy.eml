Hi Team,

I wanted to follow up on our Q4 marketing strategy discussion from last week. Here are the key points we need to address:

1. **Budget Allocation**
   - Digital advertising: $50,000
   - Content creation: $25,000
   - Event marketing: $15,000
   - Analytics tools: $10,000

2. **Target Audiences**
   - Enterprise clients (B2B focus)
   - Mid-market companies
   - Tech startups in Series A/B

3. **Campaign Timeline**
   - October: Brand awareness push
   - November: Lead generation campaigns
   - December: Holiday-themed content

4. **Key Metrics to Track**
   - Lead quality score
   - Cost per acquisition
   - Conversion rates
   - Brand sentiment

Please review and let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.

Best regards,
